# ChatGPT-made Compiler

A little experiment in understanding the nature of ChatGPT 4 as a tool.

Most of the code in this project is generated by ChatGPT. I helped it here and
there in order to save on requests (which were capped with ChatGPT 4) or
because the changes were so finicky that it couldn't have gotten it right.

The whole thing took about 5-6 hours, if I remember correctly. I did it in
April 2023, but my laptop broke at some point and the source I wrote got lost.
What's in this repo is a reconstruction of that code, based on the chat.

There are two chat sessions in [chats](chats). I had to start a new session in
order to debug an assembly bug. The original seesion got stuck when trying to
guide it to fix the bug and couldn't move forward, but the second chat with a
fresh context managed to spot the problem very quickly.

Another thing. I don't know much C++, nor assembly, but even considering that
I tried to do this experiment "blindly" without thinking too much about what
ChatGPT was doing. The purpose hasn't necessarily been to write a compiler, but
to understand what ChatGPT was capable of.
