signature FRAME =
sig
  (**
   * Holds information about formal parameters and local variables allocated in
   * the frame:
   *
   * - the locations of all the formals
   * - instructions required to implement the "view shift"
   * - the number of locals allocated so far
   * - the label at which the function's machine code is to begin
   *)
  type frame

  (**
   * Describes where formals or locals are stored â€” frame or register.
   *)
  type access

  val outermost : frame

  (**
   * For each formal parameter, this function must calculate two things:
   *
   * - how the parameter will be seen from inside the function (in a register
   *   or in a frame location)
   * - what instructions must be produced to implement the "view shift"
   *
   * For example, a frame-resident parameter will be seen as "memory at offset
   * X from the frame pointer", and the view shift will be implemented by
   * copying the stack pointer to the frame pointer on entry to the procedure.
   *)

  val formals : frame -> access list

  (**
   * The boolean parameter tells whether the local escapes.
